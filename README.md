# Sandbox-Import
Sandbox repository for import demo purposes.

## Motivation
This repository is linked to my project, [Issue Tracker](https://www.djangoissuetracker.com/), which interfaces with GitHub's public API to create, update, open, and close GitHub Issues.

## Background
The code for Issue Tracker can be found on [my personal GitHub](https://github.com/RHAM231/GitHub-Issue-Backend). See Issue Tracker's [About](https://www.djangoissuetracker.com/about) page or [README](https://github.com/RHAM231/GitHub-Issue-Backend#readme) for more background about the site's functionality and purpose.
